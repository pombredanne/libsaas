Requirements
============

For basic operation libsaas does not depend on any external modules, it just
uses the standard Python library. It is regularly tested on Python 2.6, 2.7,
3.2 and PyPy_.

Optional requirements
---------------------

Some features of libsaas do need external libraries to be installed. To use one
of the pluggable executors you will need the corresponding Python module, for
instance python-requests_ for the Requests executor.
